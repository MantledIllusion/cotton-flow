# Cotton
Cotton is a Vaadin extension destined for the ultimate of developer convenience.

## Why Cotton?

Cotton is meant to ease the start of Vaadin projects as well as offering concepts to control the growth of such applications over time.
 
It tackles these requirements by providing standardized solutions for complex problems most Vaadin application tend to require at one point or another. For example, it offers functionality like:
- Dependency Injection
- **M**odel/**V**iew/**P**resenter separation
- Fluent Component Building
- Advanced Data Binding
- View Access Restriction

... and many more.

Nevertheless, Cotton does not enforce the use of any of this functionality, but rather allows to utilize Vaadin natively whenever favored or necessary.

## In which environments can Cotton be used?

Like in native Vaadin, the base of all Cotton application is the Servlet-API.
 
 As a result, Cotton can be used in plain servlet environments as well as in Hura Web/Weblaunch applications or even in a foreign environment like Spring/Spring Boot.
